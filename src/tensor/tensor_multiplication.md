When we write a homogeneous system in matrix form AX = 0, row k of A lists the coefficients in equation K of the system. The three operations on equations correspond respectively, to the interchange of two rows of A, multiplication of a row A by a constant and addition of a scalar multiple of one row of A to another row of A We will focus on these row operations in anticipation of using them to solve the system.
