### Properties of a Tensor for Linear Operations

1. **Additivity**: Tensors can be added together component-wise, resulting in another tensor of the same order and dimensions.
   $$
   (T + S)_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n} = T_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n} + S_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n}
   $$
   
2. **Scalar Multiplication**: A tensor can be multiplied by a scalar, scaling each component of the tensor by that scalar.
   $$
   (aT)_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n} = a \cdot T_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_n}
   $$

3. **Zero Tensor**: There exists a zero tensor \(0\) such that for any tensor \(T\), 
   $$
   T + 0 = T
   $$

4. **Negation**: For any tensor \(T\), there exists a tensor \(-T\) such that 
   $$
   T + (-T) = 0
   $$

5. **Distributivity**: Scalar multiplication distributes over tensor addition.
   $$
   a(T + S) = aT + aS
   $$
   
6. **Associativity of Addition**: Tensor addition is associative.
   $$
   (T + S) + R = T + (S + R)
   $$

7. **Commutativity of Addition**: Tensor addition is commutative.
   $$
   T + S = S + T
   $$

### Properties of a Tensor for Multilinear Operations

1. **Multilinearity**: A tensor is a multilinear map, meaning it is linear in each of its arguments when the others are held fixed.
   $$
   T(a \mathbf{v} + b \mathbf{w}, \mathbf{u}) = a T(\mathbf{v}, \mathbf{u}) + b T(\mathbf{w}, \mathbf{u})
   $$
   
   $$
   T(\mathbf{u}, a \mathbf{v} + b \mathbf{w}) = a T(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v}) + b T(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{w})
   $$
   
   
   
2. **Tensor Contraction**: Tensors can be contracted, reducing the order of the tensor by summing over one or more pairs of indices.
   $$
   C_{ik} = \sum_j T_{ijk}
   $$

3. **Tensor Product**: The tensor product of two tensors \(T\) and \(S\) results in a new tensor whose order is the sum of the orders of \(T\) and \(S\).
   $$
   (T \otimes S)_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_m j_1 j_2 \ldots j_n} = T_{i_1 i_2 \ldots i_m} S_{j_1 j_2 \ldots j_n}
   $$

4. **Symmetry and Antisymmetry**: Tensors can be symmetric or antisymmetric with respect to certain indices.
   - Symmetric tensor:
     $$
     T_{ijk} = T_{jik}
     $$
   - Antisymmetric tensor:
     $$
     T_{ijk} = -T_{jik}
     $$

5. **Outer Product**: The outer product of two vectors results in a matrix (a second-order tensor).
   $$
   (a \otimes b)_{ij} = a_i b_j
   $$

6. **Duality**: There is a duality between tensors and multilinear maps, where a tensor can be seen as a multilinear map from a set of vector spaces to the underlying field.

These properties ensure that tensors can be manipulated in a consistent manner, enabling a wide range of applications in fields such as physics, engineering, and computer science.
